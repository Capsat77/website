    <p class="main_text">Withered Chica is a character from "Five Nights at Freddy's 2." She is a more deteriorated version of the original Chica animatronic from the first game. Withered Chica has a tattered appearance, missing beak, and a damaged body. Like the other withered animatronics in the game, Withered Chica becomes active during the night shifts and poses a threat to the player. Players need to keep an eye on her movements using the security cameras and take necessary precautions to avoid her entering the office and causing harm.    </p>
