    <p class="main_text">Withered Freddy is a character from "Five Nights at Freddy's 2." He's a more deteriorated version of the original Freddy Fazbear animatronic from the first game. Withered Freddy has a battered appearance, a missing face, and exposed endoskeleton. Similar to other withered animatronics in the game, Withered Freddy becomes active during the night shifts and poses a danger to the player. Players must closely monitor his movements through the security cameras and take appropriate measures to avoid his attack, such as closing doors or using the Freddy Fazbear mask.    </p>
