<p class="main_text">Withered Foxy is another character from "Five Nights at Freddy's 2." This version of Foxy is in a more dilapidated state compared to the original Foxy from the first game. Withered Foxy has a damaged, partially dismantled appearance with exposed endoskeleton and missing limbs. It is one of the animatronics that becomes active at night, and its behavior involves periodically emerging from its curtain in Pirate Cove to check on the player. Withered Foxy's mechanic adds to the suspense and challenge of the game, as players must monitor its movements and take appropriate actions to prevent its attack.</p>
